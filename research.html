<br/>My research lies at the intersection of functional analysis and operator algebras, with a focus on structural and spectral properties of bounded linear operators on Hilbert spaces. I am interested in exploring key equivalence relations such as similarity, quasi-similarity, unitary equivalence, and using these to address approximation problems in operator algebras.<br/>


<br/> “A stronger form of Yamamoto’s theorem II-Spectral operators”,
extends Yamamoto’s asymptotic singular-value theorem from finite matrices to spectral operators on a Hilbert space, proving that the normalized power sequence, \(∣A_n∣^\frac{1}{n}\), of a spectral operator \(A\), converges in norm and identifying its limit through the idempotent-valued spectral resolution of \(A\). The result bridges finite-dimensional matrix theory and infinite-dimensional operator theory, complementing Haagerup-Schultz convergence results in type \(II_1\) factors.<br/>

<br/>“On the Jordan-Chevalley-Dunford decomposition of operators in type \(I\) Murray-von Neumann algebras”, shows at first that, for \(n \ge 3\), the mapping on \(M_n(\mathbb C)\) which sends a matrix to its diagonalizable part in its Jordan-Chevalley decomposition, is <strong>norm-unbounded</strong> on any neighbourhood of the zero matrix. Then using the unboundedness of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition in \(M_n(\mathbb C)\), and convergence of the normalized power sequence for spectral operators in \(\mathscr B(\mathscr H)\), it gives a canonical Jordan-Chevalley-Dunford decomposition for densely-defined closed operators affiliated with a type \(I\) finite von Neumann algebra, by meaningfully identifying a scalar-type part and a quasinilpotent part. It also proves the convergence of normalized power sequence such operators. By observing that for a (bounded) operator in a type \(I\) finite von Neumann algebra, the aforesaid scalar-type and quasinilpotent parts in the Jordan-Chevalley-Dunford decomposition, need not be bounded, the functorial nature of Murray-von Neumann algebras indicates that considering unbounded affiliated operators is both necessary and natural in the quest for a Jordan-Chevalley-Dunford decomposition for bounded operators in finite von Neumann algebras. <br/>
